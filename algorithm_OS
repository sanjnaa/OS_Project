1.	For First and Second Iteration.
2.	For first iteration is timeQuantum =6 and for second Iteration timeQuantum =10.
3.	For(i=0 to no of processes)
	   If(arrivalTime < TimeDuration)
		    If(burstTime > timeQuantam){
			      Decrease burstTime by timeQuantum;
		     }
		   Else{
			     TimeDuration += burstTime;
			     CompilationTime = TimeDuration;
			     TurnAroundTime = CompilationTime - arrivalTime;
			     burstTime -= timeQuantum;
           Add the process to the array []; //as to check whether this process is completed later.
	  }

4.	Sort remaining processes according to remaining burstTime.
5.	Check for the process which is already completed.
6.	For(remaining process)	{
      TimeDuration += burstTime;
      CompilationTime=timeDuration;
      TurnAroundTime = CompilationTime - arrivalTime;
}
7.	Print all the process. And Average TurnAroundTime and Average Waiting Time.
